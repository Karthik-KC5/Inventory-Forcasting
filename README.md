# Inventory-Forcasting
MarketCast AI was designed as an intelligent inventory forecasting system for supermarkets, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict product sales trends. The project addressed the need for smarter stock planning in fast-moving retail environments, where real-time demand forecasting plays a critical role in avoiding overstock and stockouts.

Using historical sales data as input, the ANN model was trained to recognize seasonal patterns, daily fluctuations, and high-demand periods across thousands of product entries. The networkâ€™s architecture was tuned to optimize prediction accuracy on weekly and monthly timeframes. The system generated real-time recommendations on when to restock items and what quantity to order, helping store managers make data-backed decisions.

MarketCast AI improved inventory planning accuracy by up to 60%, significantly reducing excess inventory and increasing on-shelf availability. The project showcased the application of deep learning in solving real-world supply chain challenges, while strengthening your understanding of neural networks, feature engineering, and demand-driven retail systems.
